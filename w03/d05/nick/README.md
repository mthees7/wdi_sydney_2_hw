# Homework

## Create a CRUD app in Sinatra to manage an art gallery

You'll want two classes:
- artists
- artworks

The attributes you want to model are up to you. For artists you might want nationality and date of both. For artworks you'll want to include an image URL so you can display a picture of the work in question.

An artist has many artworks.

## Caveat
Unlike the larval foods, we want to be able to create paintings and artists separately!

/artists should show all the artists
/artworks should show all the artwork

It's possible to have a painting in the collection for which the artist is unknown.

When adding an artwork the gallery owner would like the ability to choose an artist from a drop down menu.
