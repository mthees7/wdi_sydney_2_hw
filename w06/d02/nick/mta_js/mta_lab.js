// Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines.
// Don't worry about user input. Start off by just hardcoding your stop and line choices in local variables.
// Remember, you've done this in Ruby before. Look at your code and figure out how to do it in JavaScript.
// Consider diagraming the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
// Make subway lines are keys in a hash, while the values are an array of all the stops on each line.
// The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop.
// Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
